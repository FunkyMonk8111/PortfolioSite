Portfolio web page - used for my personal freelancing

This is a website I pulled down from a themes store. I plan on making this my main portfolio website to show clients.

https://themewagon.com/themes/free-bootstrap-5-html5-css3-portfolio-website-template-proman/

demo:https://technext.github.io/proman/

Uses HTML5, CSS3
Bootstrap 5
SASS

Easy, fast, responsive site

I can even break out later with a free cms and use CMS, MVC Design Pattern or similiar, or backend database.
This can be a good portofolio plus case study.
